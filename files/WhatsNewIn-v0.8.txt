What's new in IE+ v0.8
=======================

+ GUI!!!
+ Option to toggle between GUI and Console modes
+ IE+ icon in the taskbar
+ After updating, IEPlus will tell you it has been successfully updated, and tell you the new version you are now running.
+ New welcome screen on Console mode
+ When deleting folders, IE+ now checks if they exist first to stop the console spam
+ During the fixing process, IE+ will now inform you on its progress
+ IE+ now accepts arguments such as "Credits" and "Update" on launch
+ IE+ has now reached the Beta milestone! :D
* In Console mode, IE+ will now close properly when choosing the "Quit" option, rather than just erroring the batch script and therefore forcing it to close
